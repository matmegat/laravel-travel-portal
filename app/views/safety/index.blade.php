			<p>The Whitsunday Islands are the dream tropical holiday destination. There is nothing like clear blue waters and the white sandy beaches to help you relax and release your mind from reality.</p>
			<p>Based in Airlie Beach, Visits provides both sailing and diving tours throughout the Whitsunday Islands. With Visits staff by your side you can learn to sail a state of the art catamaran. For those interested in scuba diving, check out Visits amazing PADI scuba diving courses. Become a certified scuba diver while exploring the beauty of the Whitsunday Islands and Great Barrier Reef.</p>
			<p>The Whitsunday Islands are located along the coast of Queensland. Made up of both inhabited and uninhabited islands, much of this area is protected as a national heritage site. There are 74 islands in the whole group, including Whitsunday Island, the location of iconic Whitehaven Beach. This beach is known across the world for its views, waters and unique white sands. Known as “Whispering Sands” by the Indigenous people of Australia, Whitehaven Beach is visited on most Visits tours and the ideal location for relaxing, snorkeling, and exploring what is considered by many to be the best view in Australia at Hill Inlet Lookout.</p>
			<p>Of course, what makes the Whitsunday Islands the perfect destination for a scuba diving adventure is the proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. The Whitsundays are located in the hearth of Australia’s natural wonder, and all Visits sailing and diving adventures make the most of this fact. Visitors can explore the Great Barrier Reef from above the water on Visits catamarans, or really get up close to the Great Barrier Reef wildlife, by scuba diving and snorkeling.</p>
			<p>When visiting the Whitsunday Islands, you might even see a whale. These majestic creatures travel through the Whitsundays as they migrate, and are a common site on Visits sailing and diving tours.</p>
